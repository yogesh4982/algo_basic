sample space : list of all possibilities
random variable: real valued function for event
expectation : ∑ probability * random variable

e.g. random variable = value of dice

expected value of dice = ∑ 1 / 6 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)  =  3.5

linearity of expectation 
  sum of expectation = expectation of sum
  
  e.g.
  expectation of 2 dice = expectation 1 dice + expectation 2 dice
